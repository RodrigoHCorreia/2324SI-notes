# Steps For Gomoku Game

1. **Preliminary Research**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the rules of Gomoku.

2. **Design the Game Board**:
   - 2D array to represent the board. Each position could represent empty, black, or white.
   - Create a graphical representation of the board using custom views or libraries.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - Implement the rules for making moves.
   - Check for a win condition (5 in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
   - Handle game-over scenarios.

4. **Implement Single Player (vs. AI)**:
   - Start with a basic AI that makes random legal moves.
   - For a more advanced AI, look into algorithms like Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning. This algorithm works by looking several moves ahead and trying to maximize the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Make sure game pieces (stones) are easily distinguishable.
   - Add animations for a better user experience, such as pieces sliding into place or the board shaking when there's a win.
   - Provide feedback to the user on invalid moves, wins, draws, etc.

7.  **Testing**:
   - Test on various devices and screen sizes.
   - Beta-test with a group of users to get feedback.
   - Test edge cases, such as trying to make a move outside of the board or attempting to place a stone where one already exists.

6. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement different levels of AI difficulty.
   - Add an option to undo a move.
   - Integrate leaderboards or achievements using Google Play Games services.
   - Add a tutorial or introduction for new players.
