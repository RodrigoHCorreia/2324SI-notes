# DAW Project - doubts

- How to map entities from the database into the code when we have different types of classes(e.g. in DB we have Match with a state, in the code we have different hierarchy classes for each state), do we use DB Representations? 
- Is it bad if we always set the first player to join the mathch as the BLACK player?
- What functions do we need in our repository
